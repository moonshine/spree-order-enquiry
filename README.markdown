# Order Enquiry

This Spree extension adds an "Order Status" enquiry function that allows a guest user
or registered user to enquire about the status of an order. A new link "Order Status"
is added to the login bar when the user is not logged in. When selected a form that
allows them to login or enquire about an order is displayed.

The user can enter the order number, email and shipping address post code which is used to
locate the order. If the order is found an email is sent to the order email containing
the order details.

## Usage
